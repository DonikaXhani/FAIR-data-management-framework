# FAIR-data-management-framework
This GitHub repository contains the FAIRness assessment in the manufacturing company using questions, which were formulated based on the definitions of each of the FAIR sub-principles.

The domain ontology remains private, and therefore also the ontology matching. 

The artifacts designed in this framework is the XMLPO[1], which we have presented in a different paper. XMLPO can be found in this catalog: https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-models/tree/master/models/xhani2023xmlpo.

The validation was done using the UTAUT model, and here you can find the validation form that was used by the experts, and a summary with the validation results.
